<h3><span>ILLUSTRATIONS OF CHAUCER, NO. VIII.<br />
(Vol. iii., pp. 388. 420.)</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Armorican Word "Menez."</i></p>

<p>I have been induced, in consequence of the scene of one of the
<i>Canterbury Tales</i> being</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "In <i>Armorike</i> that called is Bretaigne,"</p>

<p class="noindent">to re-examine that tale (the Frankleine's) in the expectation that in
it, if anywhere, some light might be thrown upon this newly discovered
Chaucerian word "menez"; and I think I have succeeded in detecting its
use in the sense of <i>points</i> or <i>summits</i> of <i>rocks</i> emerging from the
surface of the water.</p>

<p>But in weighing the probability of this being the true sense in which it
is used in the present instance by Chaucer, the wide applicability of
the word "means" in its usual acceptation of <i>instrument to an end</i>,
must not be lost sight of. There is scarcely the name of any one thing
for which "means" may not be made a plausible substitution; so much so,
that if a man were to ask for a hat to cover his head, his demand would
be quite intelligible if expressed by "a means" to cover his head.</p>

<p>I make this proviso as an answer to the probable objection, that
"menes," in its usual acceptation, gives sufficiently good sense to the
passage in question; it may do so, and still not be the sense intended
by the author.</p>

<p>The footing on which I wish to place the inquiry is this:</p>

<p>1st. We have an <i>Armorican</i> word which it is desirable to prove was
known to, and used by, Chaucer.</p>

<p>2dly. We find this identical word in a tale written by him, of which the
scene is <i>Armorica</i>.</p>

<p>3dly. It bears, however, a close resemblance to another word of
different meaning, which different meaning happens also to afford a
plausible sense to the same passage.</p>

<p>The question then is, in case this latter meaning should not appear to
be better, nor even so good, as that afforded by the word of which we
are in search, shall we not give that word the preference, and thereby
render it doubly blessed, giving and receiving light?</p>

<p>In coming to a decision, it is necessary to take in the whole context.
Arviragus and Dorigene live in wedded happiness, until the former,
leaving his wife, takes shipping</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p>&mdash;&mdash; "to gon and dwelle a yere or twaine</p>
      <p>In Englelond, that cleped was <i>eke</i> Bretaigne."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Dorigene, inconsolable at his loss, sits upon the sea-shore, and views
with horror the "grisly, fendly, rockes," with which the coast is
studded, in every one of which she sees certain destruction to her
husband in his return. She accuses the gods of injustice in forming
these rocks for the sole apparent purpose of destroying man, so
favoured<span class="pagenum">[474]</span> in<a id="large474"></a> other respects, and she concludes her apostrophe in
these words,&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
<p> "Than, semeth it, ye had a gret chertee</p>
      <p>Toward mankind; but how then may it be</p>
     <p> That ye such <i>men&#275;s</i> make, it to destroyen,</p>
      <p>Which <i>men&#275;s</i> don no good but ever anoyen?"</p>
</div>

<p>Undoubtedly, in the third of these lines, "menes" seems to have a
perfectly good meaning in the sense of instrument, or <i>means</i> to
destroy. But, in the last line, the same sense is not so obvious&mdash;"means
to destroy" must <i>necessarily</i> be destructive, and Chaucer would never
be guilty of the unmeaning truism of repeating&mdash;"means which do no good
but ever annoy."</p>

<p>Moreover, I am not aware that the accent is ever thrown upon the silent
<i>e</i> where the signification of "mene" is an instrument&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p>"She may be Godd&#275;s mene and Godd&#275;s whippe"&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but in the lines under discussion the last syllable in both cases is
accented, agreeing in that respect with the <i>Armorican sound</i>&mdash;"menez."</p>

<p>Let us now examine whether the Armorican <i>sense</i> is capable of giving a
perfect meaning to <i>both</i> lines? That sense is, a rocky ridge or
emerging summit. Let us substitute the word <i>rock&#275;s</i> for <i>men&#275;z</i>,
and then try what meaning the passage receives.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "If, quoth Dorigene, ye love <i>mankind</i> so well &mdash;&mdash;</p>
      <p>&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; how then may it be</p>
     <p> That ye such <i>rock&#275;s</i> make, <i>it</i> to destroyen,</p>
      <p>Which <i>rock&#275;s</i> don no good but ever anoyen?"</p>
</div>

<p>Here the sense is perfect in both lines&mdash;a sense, too, that is in exact
keeping with Dorigene's previous complaint of <span class="smcap lowercase">THE USELESSNESS</span> of these
rocks&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p>"That semen rather a foule confusion</p>
      <p>Of werk, than any faire creation</p>
      <p>Of swiche a parfit wis&#275; God and stable;</p>
      <p>Why have ye wrought this work unreasonable?</p>
      <p>For by this werk, north, south, ne west, ne est,</p>
      <p>There n'is yfostred man, ne brid, ne best;</p>
      <p><i>It doth no good</i>, to my wit, <i>but anoyeth</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>I therefore propose the following as the true reading of the passage in
question: viz.,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>  &mdash;&mdash; "Ye had a great chertee</p>
     <p> Toward mankind; but how then may it be</p>
     <p> That ye swiche menez make, it to destroyen,</p>
    <p>  Which menez don no good, but ever anoyen?"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And if I have succeeded in making good this position we no longer stand
in need of a precedent for the same reading in the case of&mdash;"In menez
libra."</p>

<p>P.S. I have been favoured, through the publisher of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>,"
with an obliging note from S.S.S. (2), communicating some authorities,
of which the most germane to this subject are&mdash;</p>

<p>1. From <i>Archæologia Britannica</i> (Edward Lhuyd. Oxford, 1707): "Armoric,
<i>Men</i>, a stone; <i>menez</i>, a mountain."</p>

<p>2. From Walter's <i>Welsh Dictionary</i>: "Welsh, <i>Maen</i>, a stone; <i>maen
terfyn</i>, a boundary stone; <i>maen mawr</i>, a large stone."</p>


<h3><span>FOLK TALK: "EYSELL", "CAPTIOUS."</span></h3>

<p>If folk lore be worthy of a place in your columns, folk talk should not
be shut out, and that the etymological solutions, gathered from this
source, which I have previously forwarded, have not appeared, is
doubtless attributable to some other cause than indifferentism to the
authority. I have found many inexplicable words and phrases, occurring
in the older writers, rendered plain and highly expressive by folk talk
definitions; and a glance at the relative positions of the common people
of this day, and the writers of the past, to the educated and scholarly
world of the nineteenth century, will suffice to show good reasons for a
discriminative reference to the language of the one, for the elucidation
of the other's expression. In common with the majority of your readers,
as I should think, I found the notes and replies on "eysell" and
"captious" to be highly interesting, and of course applied to the folk
talk for its definition. In the first case I obtained from my own
experience, what I think will be a satisfactory clue to its meaning, and
something more in addition. There is a herb of an acid taste, the common
name for which&mdash;the only one with which I am acquainted&mdash;is
<i>green-sauce</i>; and this herb is, or rather was, much sought after by
children in my boyish days. At a public school not a dozen miles from
Stratford-on-Avon, it was a common practice for we lads to spend our
holidays in roaming about the fields; and among objects of search, this
green-sauce was a prominent one, and it was a point of honour with each
of us to notify to the others the discovery of a root of green-sauce. In
doing this, the discoverer, after satisfying himself by his taste that
the true herb was found, followed an accepted course, and signified his
success to his companions by raising his voice and shouting, what I have
always been accustomed to write, "Hey-sall." I have no knowledge of the
origin of this word; it was with us as a school-rule so to use it; and I
have no doubt but that "ey-sell" was in Shakspeare's time the popular
name for the herb to which I allude.</p>

<p>Mixing much with the rural population of Warwickshire, I have, on many
occasions, seen the word "captious" used in the sense of carping,
irritable, unthankfulness, and self-willed; and, in my humble opinion,
such a rendering would be more in accordance with the character of the
fiction, and the poet's early teaching, than any definition I have yet
seen in <a id="your475"></a>your pages. <span class="pagenum">[475]</span></p>

<h3><span>AN OLD MAN WHOSE FATHER LIVED IN THE TIME OF OLIVER CROMWELL.</span></h3>

<p class="blockquot">[We are indebted to the kindness of the Rev. T<span class="smcap lowercase">HOMAS</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORSER</span> for
   the opportunity of preserving in our columns the following
   interesting notice, from the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> of the 19th
   August, 1843, of the subject of his communication in our No. for
   May 31. (No. 83, p. 421.)]</p>

<p>Having heard of the extraordinary circumstance of an old man named James
Horrocks, in his hundredth year, living in Harwood, about three miles
from Bolton, whose father lived in the time of Oliver Cromwell, we took
an opportunity, a few days ago, of visiting this venerable descendant of
a sire who was contemporary with the renowned Protector. Until within
the last few years he resided at Hill End, a small estate left him by an
uncle when he was about twenty-six years old; but both his surviving
daughters being married, and himself growing feeble, and his sight
failing him, he left the land and went to reside with his eldest
daughter, Margaret, and his son-in-law, John Haslam, at a place called
"The Nook," near the Britannia, in Harwood. Here we found the old man,
surrounded with every comfort which easy circumstances and affectionate
friends can afford, and, to use his own language, "neither tired of
living, nor yet afraid to die." He is a remarkably good-looking old man,
with long, silvery locks, and a countenance beaming with benevolence and
good nature. He has nearly lost the use of his eye-sight, and is a
little dull of hearing, yet he is enabled to walk about. The loss of his
sight he regrets most of all, as it prevents him from spending his time
in reading, to which he was before accustomed; and, as he remarked, also
denies him the pleasure of looking upon his children and his old
friends. He converses with remarkable cheerfulness for one of his years.
As an instance, we may mention, that, on observing to him that he must
have been a tall man in his youth, he sprang up from his arm chair with
the elasticity of middle age, rather than the decrepitude usually
accompanying those few who are permitted to spin out the thread of life
to the extent of a century, and, with a humorous smile upon his
countenance, put his hands to his thighs, and stood as straight as an
arrow against a gentleman nearly six feet, remarking, at the same time,
"I don't think I am much less now than ever I was." He stands now about
five feet eight inches and a half. A short time ago, on coming down
stairs in the morning, he observed to his daughter, with his accustomed
good humour, and buoyancy of spirit, "I wonder what I shall dream next;
I dreamt last night that I was going to be married again; and who knows
but I could find somebody that would have me yet." His son-in-law is an
old grey-headed man, much harder of hearing than himself; and it
frequently happens, that when any of the family are endeavouring to
explain anything to him, old James will say, "Stop, and I'll <i>insense</i>
him;" and his lungs seldom fail in the undertaking.</p>

<p>From this interesting family we learn, that William Horrocks, the father
of the present James, of whom we have been speaking, was born in 1657,
four years after Oliver Cromwell was declared protector, and one year
before his death. He would be two years old when Richard Cromwell, who
succeeded his father, resigned; and four years old when Charles II. was
crowned in 1661. The exact period of his first marriage we have not been
able to ascertain; but it is certain that his bride was employed as
nurse in the well-known family of the Chethams, either at Turton Tower,
or at Castleton Hall, near Rochdale. By this marriage he had four
children, as appears from the following memorandums, written in an
excellent hand in the back of an old black-letter Bible, printed in
1583:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Mary, the daughter of William and Elizabeth Horrocks, was born
   the 15th day of September, and baptised the 23d day of the same
   month, Anno Dom. 1683."</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "John, the son of William and Elizabeth Horrocks, was born the
   18th day of January, and baptized the 25th day of the same month,
   Anno Dom. 1686."</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Ann, the daughter of William and Elizabeth Horrocks, was born
   the 14th day of March, and baptized the 23d day of the same
   month, Anno Dom. 1699."</p>

<p class="blockquot">"William, the son of William and Elisabeth Horrocks, was born the
   9th day of June, and baptised the 17th day of the same month,
   Anno Dom. 1700."</p>

<p>At what time his wife died, we are also unable to ascertain; but there
is no doubt he remained a widower for many years, and at length married
his housekeeper, a comely blooming young woman, whose kindness to the
old man was unremitting, and he married her in 1741, at the age of
eighty-four, she being at the time only twenty-six.</p>

<p>This marriage evidently attracted much attention in the neighbourhood,
and we find that, about two years afterwards, the old man and his
youthful partner were sent for to Castleton Hall, the residence of a
branch of Humphry Chetham's family, where they were treated with great
kindness, and a portrait painter engaged to take their likenesses, which
are now in the possession of their son, and add much to the interest of
a visit to him. These portraits are well executed; and, of course,
appear rather like those of a grandfather and his grandchild than of
husband and wife, although he appears more like sixty than eighty-six.
In front of each painting is prominently inscribed the age of each of
the parties, and the date when the portrait was taken. Upon that of the
husband the inscription is, "ÆTA: 86&mdash;1743." And upon that of the wife,
"ÆTA: 28&mdash;1743." These, it appears, were taken two years after their
marriage,<span class="pagenum">[476]</span> and<a id="of476"></a> preserved in the Chetham family, at Castleton Hall,
as great curiosities.</p>

<p>In the following year, the present James was born, as appears from the
following entry on the back of the same old Bible:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "James, the son of William and Elizabeth Horrocks of Bradshaw
   Chapel, was born March 14th, 1744."</p>

<p class="noindent">He will therefore complete his hundredth year on the 14th of next March.
He was born in a house near Bradshaw Chapel, which has long since been
removed. He was about twenty-seven years old when an uncle left him a
small estate in Harwood, called Hill End; and soon after he married, we
believe in 1773, and by that marriage had eight children. William, the
son of James and Margaret Horrocks, was born February 21, 1776;
Margaret, March 31, 1778; John, August 11, 1781; Simon, Dec. 23, 1783;
Matty, June 28, 1786; James, Jan. 13, 1789; Sarah, Sept. 22, 1791; and
Betty, Jan. 8, 1794.</p>

<p>Of these, the only survivors are Margaret, aged sixty-five, the wife of
John Haslam, with whom the old man now resides; and Betty, the youngest,
aged forty-nine, who is married, and has four children.</p>

<p>The old man was only eleven years old when his father died, and has no
recollection of hearing him mention any remarkable event occurring in
his lifetime.</p>

<p>On asking the old man how he came into possession of the portraits of
his father and mother, he stated, that, some years ago, he saw in the
newspapers a sale advertised of the property at Castleton Hall, and went
there before the day to inquire after the portraits, with the view of
purchasing them before the sale. The servants at the hall admitted him,
and he found they were not there. He then went to the house of the
steward, and found he was not at home; he, however, left a message,
desiring that the steward would send him word if there was any
probability of his being able to purchase the portraits. Accordingly,
the steward sent him word that they had been removed, with the family
portraits, to the residence of a lady near Manchester, where he might
have the satisfaction of seeing them. The old man cannot remember either
the name or the address of the lady. However, he went to the place, in
company with a friend, and saw the lady, who treated him with the
greatest kindness. She showed him the portraits, and was so much pleased
with the desire he manifested to purchase them, that she said, if she
could be certain that he was the heir, she would make him a present of
them, as his filial affection did him great honour. His friend assured
her that he was the only child of his mother by William Horrocks, and
she then gave them to him, although she parted with them with regret, as
she had no other paintings that attracted so much attention. His
recollection of the circumstances are so perfect, that he remembers
offering a gratuity to the servants for packing the portraits, which the
lady would not allow them to receive.</p>

<p>As an instance of the health and vigour of this remarkable old man, it
may be mentioned, that ten years ago, in the winter of 1832-3, he
attended at Newton, to vote for Lord Molyneux, then a candidate for
South Lancashire. He was then in his ninetieth year. He walked from
Harwood to Bolton, a distance of three miles. From thence he went to
Newton by the railway; and, having voted, he by some means missed the
train, and walked to Bolton, a distance of fifteen miles. On arriving
there he took some refreshment, and again set out for Harwood, and
accomplished the distance of twenty-one miles in the day, in the depth
of winter.&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian</i>, Aug. 19, 1843.</p>


<h3><span class="bla">Minor Notes.</span></h3>

<h4><span><i>On a Passage in Sedley.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;There is a couplet in Sir Charles Sedley's
poems, which is quoted as follows in a work in my possession:</p>

  <div class="poem">
 <p>   "Let fools the name of loyalty divide:</p>
      <p>Wise men and Gods are on the strongest side."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Does the context require the word "divide?" or is it a misprint for
"deride?" Of course, the latter word would completely alter the sense,
but it seems to me that it would make it more consistent with truth. The
word "divide" supposes loyalty to be characteristic of fools, and places
the Gods in antagonism to that sentiment; while the word "deride"
restores them to their natural position.</p>

<h4><span><i>On a Passage in Romeo and Juliet.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In the encounter between Mercutio
and Tybalt (Act III. Sc. 1.), in which Mercutio is killed, he addresses
Tybalt tauntingly thus:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Good king of cats, &amp;c., will you pluck your sword out of his
   <i>pilcher</i> by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your ears
   ere it be out."</p>

<p class="noindent">The first quarto has <i>scabbard</i>, all the later editions have <i>pilcher</i>,
a word occurring nowhere else. There has been a vain attempt to make
<i>pilcher</i> signify a <i>leathern sheath</i>, because a <i>pilch</i> was a <i>garment
of leather</i> or <i>pelt</i>. To me it is quite evident that <i>pilcher</i> is a
mere typographical error for <i>pitcher</i>, which, in this jocose, bantering
speech, Mercutio substitutes for <i>scabbard</i>, else why are the <i>ears</i>
mentioned? The poet was familiar with the proverb "Pitchers have ears,"
of which he has elsewhere twice availed himself. The <i>ears</i>, as every
one knows, are the <i>handles</i>, which have since been called the <i>lugs</i>.
Shakspeare would hardly have substituted a word of his own creation for
<i>scabbard</i>; but <i>pitcher</i> was suggested by the play<span class="pagenum">[477]</span> upon<a id="correctness477"></a> the word
<i>ears</i>, which is used for <i>hilts</i> in the plural, according to the
universal usage of the poet's time. The <i>ears</i>, applied to a <i>leathern
coat</i>, or even a <i>sheath</i>, would be quite unmeaning, but there is a well
sustained ludicrous image in "pluck your sword out of his <i>pitcher by
the ears</i>."</p>

<h3><span>PRINCESSES OF WALES.</span></h3>

<p>Blackstone, in his <i>Commentaries</i>, vol. i. p. 224., says, the heir
apparent to the crown is usually made Prince of Wales and Earl of
Chester; upon which Mr. Christian in a note remarks, upon the authority
of Hume, that this creation has not been confined to the heir apparent,
for both Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth were created by their father,
Henry VIII., Princesses of Wales, each of them at the time (the latter
after the legitimation of Mary) being heir presumptive to the crown.</p>

<p>Can any of your correspondents inform me upon what authority this
statement of Hume rests? or whether there exists any evidence of such
creations having been made? Do any such creations appear upon the Patent
Rolls? The statement is not supported by any writer of authority upon
such subjects, and, as far as your Querist's investigation has
proceeded, seems without foundation. It is one, however, too important
in connexion with royal titles to remain uncontradicted, if the fact be
not so.</p>

<p>&mdash;When the witches in this country were very numerous, Satan for

there is a large dent or hollow, visible at the distance of twenty

<p>Can any of your readers assist me in discovering the origins of this
singular name? There is a foolish tradition that the Devil was obliged,
by one of the saints, to make a road for his Reverence across an

(See vol. ii., pp. 274. 278.) I doubt, or even disbelieve, the Britons
having had <i>any</i> name for a ship, though they had a name for an osier
floating basket, covered with raw hides. And when they became familiar
with the <i>navis longa</i> of the Romans, they and their Gaelic neighbours
adopted the adjective, and not the substantive. But the question of
<i>nao</i> is one of fact; and having got the assertion, I want the
authority.</p>

Conte d'Olivares," and at the end is signed "Scritta da Ferrante
Pallavicino," and dated "28 Genaro, 1643." Of course this Count
d'Olivares was the great favourite of Philip IV. of Spain; but who was
Pallavicino? Could it have been the Paravicino who was court chaplain to
Philip III. and IV.? or was he of the Genoese family of Pallavicini
mentioned by Leigh Hunt (<i>Autobiography</i>, vol. ii. p. 177.) as having
been connected with the Cromwell family? What favours the latter
presumption is, that a gentleman to whom I showed the MS. said at once,
"That is Genoa paper, just the same I got there for rough copies;" and
he also told me that the water-mark was a well-known Genoa mark: it
consists of a bird standing on an eight pointed starlike flower.</p>

<p>If any one can give me any likely account of this Pallavicino, or tell
me whether the MS. is at all valuable in any way, I shall owe him many
thanks.</p>

<h3><span>GREENE'S "GROATSWORTH OF WITTE."<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 140.)</span></h3>

<p>In answer to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ALLIWELL</span>'s Query, "whether the remarkable passage
respecting Shakspeare in this work has descended to us in its genuine
state," I beg to inform him that I possess a copy of the edition of
1596, as well as of those of 1617 and 1621, from the latter of which the
reprint by Sir Egerton Brydges was taken, and that the passage in
question is exactly the same in all the three editions. For the general
information of your readers interested in Greene's works, I beg to
state, that the variations in the edition of 1596 from the other two,
consist of the words "written before his death, and published at his
dying request," on the title; and instead of the introductory address
"To Wittie Poets, or Poeticall Wittes," signed I. H., there are a few
lines on A 2, "The Printer to the Gentle Readers:"</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I haue published heere, Gentlemen, for your mirth and benefit,
   Greene's Groateswoorth of Wit. With sundry of his pleasant
   discourses ye haue beene before delighted: But now hath death
   giuen a period to his pen, onely this happened into my hands
   which I haue published for your pleasures: Accept it fauourably
   because it was his last birth, and not least worth, in my poore

   conceit, and leaue it selfe to speake for it selfe: and so abide
   your learned censuring.</p>

<p class="right">      "Yours, W. W."</p>

<p class="noindent">Then follows another short address, "To the Gentlemen Readers," by
Greene himself; and as this edition is so rare, only two copies being
known, and the address is short, I transcribe it entire for your
insertion:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Gentlemen, The Swan sings melodiously before death, that in all
   his life time vseth but a iarring sound. <i>Greene</i>, though able
   inough to write, yet deeplyer searched with sicknesse than euer
   heretofore, sendes you his swanne-like song, for that he feares
   he shall neuer againe carroll to you woonted loue layes, neuer
   againe discouer to you youth's pleasures. Howeuer yet sicknesse,
   riot, incontinence, haue at once shown their extremitie, yet if I
   recouer, you shall all see more fresh springs then euer sprang
   from me, directing you how to liue, yet not diswading you from
   loue. This is the last I haue writ, and I feare me the last I
   shall write. And how euer I haue beene censured for some of my
   former bookes, yet, Gentlemen, I protest, they were as I had
   special information. But passing them, I commend this to your
   fauourable censures, and like an Embrion without shape, I feare
   me will bee thrust into the world. If I liue to ende it, it shall
   be otherwise: if not, yet will I commend it to your courtesies,
   that you may as wel be acquainted with my repentant death, as you
   haue lamented my carelesse course of life. But as <i>Nemo ante
   obitum felix</i>, so <i>Acta exitus probat</i>: Beseeching therefore to
   bee deemed hereof as I deserue, I leaue the worke to your liking,
   and leaue you to your delights."</p>

<p class="noindent">Greene died in September, 1592; and this is curious, as being probably
the last thing that ever came from his pen.</p>

<p>The work commences on sig. A 4, the other three leaves being occupied
with the title and the two addresses. It concludes with Greene's "letter
written to his wife," and has not "Greene's Epitaph: Discoursed
Dialogue-wise betweene Life and Death," which is in the two later
editions.</p>

<p>I may here mention that I possess a copy of an extremely rare work

<h3><span>THE DUTCH MARTYROLOGY.<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 443.)</span></h3>

<p>Besides the copy of the above work mentioned by your correspondent J. H.
T., several others are known to exist in this country. Among them I may
mention one in the library of the Baptist College, Bristol. My own copy
was supplied by a London bookseller, who has likewise imported several
other copies from Holland, where it is by no means a scarce work.</p>

<p>The second illustrated edition was published twenty years after the
decease of Van Braght. The first edition, without engravings, now before
me, appeared in 1660, which was the edition used by Danvers. But Danvers
does not appear to have known its existence, when the first edition of
his treatise came out in 1673. The "large additions" of his second
edition in 1674, are chiefly made from the work of Van Braght.</p>

<p>The original portion of Van Braght's work is, however, confined to the
first part. The second part, <i>The Martyrology</i>, strictly so called, is
of much earlier date. Many single narratives appeared at the time, and
collections of these were early made. The earliest collection of
martyrdoms bears the date of 1542. This was enlarged in 1562, 1578,
1580, and 1595. This fact I give on the authority of Professor Müller of
Amsterdam, from the<span class="pagenum">[480]</span> <i>Jaarboekje voor de Doopsgezinde Gemeenten in
de Nederlanden, 1838 en 1839</i>, <a id="strange480"></a>pp. 102, 103.</p>

<p>An edition, dated 1599, of these very rare books is now before me. It
has the following curious and affecting title:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Dit Boeck wort genaemt: Het Offer des Heeren, Om het inhout van
   sommige opgeofferde Kinderen Gods, de welcke voort gebrocht
   hebben, wt den goeden schat haers herten, Belijdinghen,
   Sentbrieuen ende Testamenten, de welcke sy met den monde beleden,
   ende met den bloede bezeghelt hebben, &amp;c. &amp;c. Tot Harlinghen. By
   my Peter Sebastiaenzoon, Int jaer ons Heeren <span class="smcap lowercase">MDXCIX</span>."</p>

<p>It is a thick 12mo. of 229 folios, and contains the martyrdoms of
thirty-three persons (the first of which is Stephen), which were
subsequently embodied in the larger martyrologies. Each narrative is
followed by a versified version of it. A small book of hymns is added,
some of them composed by the martyrs; and the letters and confession of
one Joos de Tollenaer, who was put to death at Ghent in 1589.</p>

<p>In 1615, a large collection of these narratives appeared at Haarlem in a
thick 4to. volume. The compilers were Hans de Ries, Jaques Outerman, and
Joost Govertsoon, all eminent Mennonite ministers. Two editions followed
from the press of Zacharias Cornelis at Hoorn in 1617 and 1626, both in
4to., but under different editorship. The last edition was offensive to
the Haarlem editors, who therefore published a fourth at Haarlem in
1631. As its title is brief, I will give it from the copy in my library:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Martelaers Spiegel der Werelose Christenen t' zedert <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1524.
   Joan, xv. 20. Matt. x. 28. Esai, li. 7. Joan xvi. 2. 1 Pet. iv.
   19. [All quoted at length.] Gedrukt tot Haarlem Bij Hans
   Passchiers van Wesbusch. In't Jaer onses Heeren, 1631."</p>

<p>This edition is in small folio. The title-page is from a copperplate,
and is adorned with eight small engravings, representing scenes of
suffering and persecution from scripture. The narratives of martyrs
extends from 1524 to 1624. It is this work which forms the basis of Van
Braght's. He added to it the whole of his first part, and also some
additional narratives in the second. To the best of his ability he
verified the whole.</p>

<p>These works are frequently referred to by Ottius in his <i>Annales
Anabaptistici</i> under the titles "Martyrologium Harlemense" and
"Martyrologium Hornanum."</p>

<p>From a paper in the <i>Archivs für Kunde österreichischer
Geschichtsquellen</i>, I learn that a MS. exists in the City library of
Hamburgh, with the following title:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Chronickel oder Denkbüechel darinnen mit kurtzen Begriffen, Was
   sich vom 1524 Jar, Bis auff gegenwärtige Zeit, in der gemain
   zuegetragen, vnd wie viel trewer Zeugen Jesu Christij die warheit
   Gottes so riterlich mit irem bluet bezeugt. 1637."</p>

<p>The work appears chiefly confined to a history of the Moravian
Anabaptists: but from passages given by the writer, Herr Gregor Wolny,
it is evident that it contains many of the narratives given by Van
Braght. The earlier portion of the MS. was written previous to 1592,
when its writer or compiler died. Three continuators carried on the
narrations to 1654. The last date in it is June 7, 1654; when Daniel
Zwicker, in his own handwriting, records his settlement as pastor over a
Baptist church. Mention is made of this MS. by Ottius, and by Fischer in
his <i>Tauben-kobel</i>, p. 33., &amp;c. For any additional particulars
respecting it, I should feel greatly obliged.</p>

<p>It does not appear to be known to your correspondent that a translation
of the second part of Van Braght's work has been commenced in this
country, of which the first volume was issued by the Hanserd Knollys
Society last year. A translation of the entire work appeared in 1837, in
Pennsylvania, U. S., for the use of the Mennonite churches, emigrants
from Holland and Germany to whom the language of their native land had
become a strange tongue.</p>

circa 1738, formerly of some repute. Among other legends of the Club, is

<h4><span><i>Handel's Occasional Oratorio </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 426.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The "Occasional
Oratorio" is a separate composition, containing an overture, 10
recitatives, 21 airs, 1 duet, and 15 choruses. It was produced in the
year 1745. It is reported, I know not on what authority, that the King
having ordered Handel to produce a new oratorio on a given day, and the
artist having answered that it was impossible to do it in the time
(which must have been unreasonably short, to extort such a reply from
the intellect that produced <i>The Messiah</i> in three weeks, and <i>Israel in
Egypt</i> in four), his<span class="pagenum">[481]</span> <a id="Majesty481"></a>Majesty deigned no other answer than that
done it must and should be, whether possible or not, and that the result
was the putting forward of the "Occasional Oratorio."</p>

<p>The structure of the oratorio, which was evidently a very hurried
composition, gives a strong air of probability to the anecdote.
Evidently no libretto was written for it; the words tell no tale, are
totally unconnected, and not even always tolerable English, a fine
chorus (p. 39. Arnold) going to the words "Him or his God we no fear."
It is rather a collection of sacred pieces, strung together literally
without rhyme or reason in the oratorio form, than one oratorio. The
examination of it leads one to the conclusion, that the composer took
from his portfolio such pieces as he happened to have at hand, strung
them together as he best could, and made up the necessary quantity by
selections from his other works. Accordingly we find in it the pieces
"The Horse and his Rider," "Thou shalt bring them in," "Who is like unto
Thee?" "The Hailstone Chorus," "The Enemy said I will pursue," from
<i>Israel in Egypt</i>, written in 1738; the chorus "May God from whom all
Mercies spring," from <i>Athaliah</i> (1733); and the chorus "God save the
King, long live the King," from the <i>Coronation Anthem</i> of 1727. There
is also the air "O! Liberty," which he afterwards (in 1746) employed in
<i>Judas Maccabæus</i>. Possibly some other pieces of this oratorio may be
found also in some of Handel's other works, not sufficiently stamped on
my memory for me to recognise them; but I may remark that the quantity
of <i>Israel in Egypt</i> found in it may perhaps have so connected it in
some minds with that glorious composition as to have led to the practice
referred to of prefixing in performance the overture to the latter work,
to which, although the introductory movement, the fine adagio, and grand
march are fit enough, the light character of the fugue is, it must be
confessed, singularly inappropriate.</p>

<p>I am not aware of any other "occasion" than that of the King's will,
which led to the composition of this oratorio.</p>

<h4><span><i>Carved Ceiling in Dorsetshire </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 424.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Philip, King of
Castile (father to Charles V.), was forced by foul weather into Weymouth
Harbour. He was hospitably entertained by Sir Thomas Trenchard, who
invited Mr. Russell of Kingston Russell to meet him. King Philip took
such delight in his company that at his departure he recommended him to
King Henry VII. as a person of spirit "fit to stand before princes, and
not before mean men." He died in 1554, and was the ancestor of the
Bedford family. Sir Thomas Trenchard probably had the ceiling. See
Fuller's <i>Worthies</i> (<i>Dorsetshire</i>), vol. i. p. 313.</p>

<p class="right">   A. H<span class="smcap lowercase">OLT</span> W<span class="smcap lowercase">HITE</span>.</p>

<p>The house of which your correspondent has heard his tradition is
certainly <i>Woolverton House</i>, in the parish of Charminster, near this
town.</p>

<p>It was built by Sir Thomas Trenchard, who died 20 Hen. VIII.; and
tradition holds, as history tells us, that Phillip, Archduke of Austria,
and King of Castile, with his queen <i>Juana</i>, or <i>Joanna</i>, were driven by
weather into the port of Weymouth: and that Sir Thomas Trenchard, then
the High Sheriff of the county, invited their majesties to his house,
and afforded them entertainment that was no less gratifying than timely.</p>

<p>Woolverton now belongs to James Henning, Esq. There is some fine carving
in the house, though it is not the ceiling that is markworthy; and it is
thought by some to be the work of a foreign hand. At Woolverton House
were founded the high fortunes of the House of Bedford. Sir Thomas
Trenchard, feeling the need of an interpreter with their Spanish
Majesties, happily bethought himself of a John Russell, Esq., of
Berwick, who had lived some years in Spain, and spoke Castilian; and
invited him, as a Spanish-English mouth, to his house: and it is said he
accompanied the king and queen to London, where he was recommended to
the favour of Hen. VII.; and after rising to high office, received from
Hen. VIII. a share of the monastic lands.</p>

<h4><span><i>"Felix quem faciunt," &amp;c. </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., pp. 373. 431.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The passage
cited by C. H. P. as assigned to Plautus, and which he says he cannot
find in that author, occurs in one of the interpolated scenes in the
<i>Mercator</i>, which are placed in some of the old editions between the 5th
and 6th Scenes of Act IV. In the edition by Pareus, printed at Neustadt
(Neapolis Nemetum) in 1619, 4to., it stands thus:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Verum id dictum est: Feliciter is sapit, qui periculo alieno
   sapit."</p>

<p>I was wrong in attributing it to Plautus, and should rather have called
it <i>Plautine</i>. By a strange slip of the pen or the press, pericu<i>lum</i> is
put instead of pericu<i>lo</i> in my note. Niebuhr has a very interesting
essay on the interpolated scenes in Plautus, in the first volume of his
<i>Kleine Historische und Philologische Schriften</i>, which will show why
these scenes and passages, marked as supposititious in some editions,
are now omitted. It appears that they were made in the fifteenth century
by Hermolaus Barbarus. See a letter from him to the Bishop of Segni, in
<i>Angeli Politiani Epistolæ</i>, lib. xii. epist. 25.</p>

<p>To the parallel thoughts already cited may be added the following:</p>

<h4><span><i>The Saint Graal </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 413.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I see that M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. G. S<span class="smcap lowercase">TEPHENS</span>
states, that Mons. Roquefort's nine columns are decisive of Saint Graal
being derived from Sancta Cratera. I am unacquainted with the word
<i>cratera</i>, unless in Ducange, as meaning a basket. But <i>crater</i>, a
goblet, is the word meant by Roquefort.</p>

<p>How should <i>graal</i> or <i>greal</i> come from <i>crater</i>? I cannot see common
sense in it. Surely that ancient writer, nearly, or quite, contemporary
with the publication of the romance, Helinandus Frigidimontanus, may be
trusted for the fact that <i>graal</i> was French for "gradalis or gradale,"
which meant "scutella lata et aliquantulum profunda in quâ preciosæ
dapes cum suo jure divitibus solent apponi." (Vide Helinand. ap.
Vincentium Bellovacensem, <i>Speculum Historiale</i>, lib. 43. cap. 147.) Can
there be a more apparent and palpable etymology of any word, than that
<i>graal</i> is <i>gradale</i>? See Ducange in <i>Gradale</i>, No. 3, and in
<i>Gradalis</i>, and the three authorities (of which Helinand is not one)
cited by him.</p>

there said to be equivalent to <i>blawnsherres</i>. The scattered pages of
Duns Scotus were put to this use, after he was banished from Oxford by
the Royal Commissioners.</p>

<p>The word is perhaps akin to the low Latin <i>suellium</i>, threshing-floor,
or to the Norman French <i>swele</i>, threshold: in which case the original

<h4><span><i>The Curse of Scotland </i></span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 22.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent L.
says, the true explanation of the circumstance of the nine of diamonds
being called the curse of Scotland is to be found in the game of Pope
Joan; but with all due deference to him, I must beg entirely to dissent
from this opinion, and to adhere to the notion of its origin being
traceable to the heraldic bearing of the family of Dalrymple, which are
or, on a saltire azure, <i>nine lozenges of the field</i>.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that John Dalrymple, 2nd Viscount and 1st Earl of
Stair, justly merited the appellation of the "Curse of Scotland," from
the part which he took in the horrible massacre of Glencoe, and from the
utter detestation in which he was held in consequence, and which
compelled him to resign the secretaryship in 1695. After a deliberate
inquiry by the commissioners had declared <i>him</i> to be guilty of the
massacre, we cannot wonder that the man should be held up to scorn by
the most popular means which presented themselves; and the nine diamonds
in his shield would very naturally, being the insignia of his family, be
the best and most easily understood mode of perpetuating that
detestation in the minds of the people.</p>

<h4><span><i>To learn by Heart</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iii., p. 425.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;When A S<span class="smcap lowercase">UBSCRIBER TO YOUR</span>
J<span class="smcap lowercase">OURNAL</span> asks for some account of the origin of the phrase "to learn by
Heart," may he not find it in St. Luke i. 66, ii. 19. 51.?</p>

<p>"To learn by <i>memory</i>" (or by "<i>rote</i>") conveys to my own mind a very
different notion from what I conceive to be expressed by the words "To
learn by <i>heart</i>." Just as there is an evident difference between a
<i>gentleman in heart and feeling</i>, and a <i>gentleman in manners and
education only</i>; so there is a like difference (as I conceive) between
learning by heart and learning by rote; namely, the difference between a
<i>moral</i>, and a merely <i>intellectual</i>, operation of the mind. To learn by
<i>memory</i> is to learn by <i>rote</i>, as a parrot: to learn by <i>heart</i> is to
learn <i>morally&mdash;practically</i>. Thus, we say, we give our hearts to our
pursuits: we "love God with all our hearts," pray to Him "with the
spirit, and with the understanding," and "with the heart believe unto
righteousness:" we "ponder in our hearts," "muse in our hearts," and
"keep things in our hearts," i. e. "<i>learn by heart</i>."</p>

has adopted the prevailing opinion that it is a contemptible libel. In a
note to the former edition is a reference to Kennett's <i>Register</i>, p.
38., and to <i>"Private forms of Prayer fitted for the late sad times,"
&amp;c.</i>, 12mo., Lond., 1660, attributed to Dr. Hammond. An anonymous
author, quoting the verbal assurance<span class="pagenum">[485]</span> <a id="of485"></a>of "a certain active Whigg,"
would be entitled to little credit in attacking the character of the

stated my reason for the inquiry; that it contained an apology for the
liberty taken in applying to a stranger; and that Mr. Sockett did not
honour me with any answer. I believe, however, that I asked whether the
register still existed; if so, what was its nature, and over what period
it extended; and whether it had been printed or described in any
antiquarian or topographical book.</p>

<p>Perhaps some reader may have the means of giving information on these
points; and if he will do so through the medium of your periodical, he
will oblige both C. H. and myself. Or perhaps C. H. may be able to

transition from <i>cap à pied</i>, or "cap à pie," to <i>apple-pie</i>, has rather

  <div class="poem"> <p>   "That crystalline sphere whose balance weighs</p>
     <p> The trepidation talk'd, and that first moved."</p></div>

<p>Paterson's comment, quoted by your correspondent, is exquisite: he
evidently thinks there were two trepidations, one <i>talked</i>, the other
<i>first moved</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>trepidation</i> (not a tremulous, but a turning or oscillating motion)
is a well-known hypothesis added by the Arab astronomers to Ptolemy, in
explanation of the precession of the equinoxes. This precession they
imagined would continue retrograde for a long period, after which it
would be direct for another long period, then retrograde again, and so
on. They, or their European followers, I forget which, invented the
<i>crystal</i> heaven, an apparatus outside of the <i>starry</i> heaven
(these<span class="pagenum">[486]</span> cast-off <a id="phrases486"></a>phrases of astronomy have entered into the
service of poetry, and the <i>empyreal</i> heaven with them), to cause this
slow turning, or trepidation, in the starry heaven. Some used <i>two</i>
crystal heavens, and I suspect that Paterson, having some confused idea
of this, fancied he found them both in Milton's text. I need not say
that your correspondent is quite right in referring the words <i>first
moved</i> to the <i>primum mobile</i>.</p>

<p>Again, <i>balance</i> in Milton never <i>weighs</i>. <i>Scale</i> is his word (iv. 997.

balance the left wing. The direct motion of the crystal heaven,
following and compensating the retrograde one, is the "balance" which
"<i>was</i> the trepidation <i>called</i>;" and this I suspect to be the true
reading. The past tense would be quite accurate, for all the Ptolemaists
of Milton's time had abandoned the <i>trepidation</i>. As the text stands it
is nonsense; even if Milton did <i>dictate</i> it, we know that he never
<i>saw</i> it; and there are several passages of which the obscurity may be
due to his having had to rely on others. Witness the lines in book iv.

<p>&mdash;I forward extracts from the Registers of the parish of Saint Benedict in
this town relating to the baptism of Dissenters. (Mr. Hussey, mentioned
in several of the entries, was Joseph Hussey, minister of a Dissenting
congregation here from 1691 to 1720. His meeting-house on Hog Hill (now
St. Andrew's Hill) in this town was pillaged by a Jacobite mob, 29th
May, 1716. He died in London in 1726, and was the author of several
works, which are now very scarce.)</p>

</h4>
<p>&mdash;I think that upon further
consideration C.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;A. will find his egg to be merely that of a
blackbird. While the eggs of some birds are so constant in their
markings that to see one is to know all, others&mdash;at the head of which we
may place the sparrow, the gull tribe, the thrush, and the
blackbird&mdash;are as remarkable for the curious variety of their markings,
and even of the shades of their colouring. And every schoolboy's
collection will show that these distinctions will occur in the same
nest.</p>

<p>I also believe that there has been some mistake about the nest, for
though, like the thrush, the blackbird coats the interior of its nest
with mud, &amp;c., it does not, like that bird, leave this coating exposed,
but adds another lining of soft dried grass.</p>

<p>&mdash;A correspondent, C. P. P<span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>***., asks
"What is Champak?" He will find a full description of the plant in Sir
William Jones's "Botanical Observations on Select Indian Plants," vol.
v. pp. 128-30. <i>Works</i>, ed. 1807. In speaking of it, he says:</p>


<p class="blockquot">"The strong aromatic scent of the gold-coloured Champac is
   thought offensive to the bees, who are never seen on its
   blossoms; but their elegant appearance on the black hair of the
   Indian women is mentioned by Rumphius; and both facts have
   supplied the Sanscrit poets with elegant allusions."

<p>The first volume issued to the members of the Camden Society in return
for the present year's subscription affords in more than one way
evidence of the utility of that Society. It is an account <i>of Moneys
received and paid for Secret Services of Charles II. and James II.</i>, and
is edited by Mr. Akerman from a MS. in the possession of William Selby
Lowndes, Esq. Of the value of the book as materials towards illustrating
the history of the period over which the payments extend, namely from
March 1679 to December 1688, there can be as little doubt, as there can
be that but for the Camden Society it never could have been published.
As a publishing speculation it could not have tempted any bookseller;
even if its owner would have consented to its being so given to the
world: and yet that in the simple entries of payments to the Duchess of
Portsmouth, to "Mrs. Ellinor Gwynne," to "Titus Oates," to the
Pendrells, &amp;c., will be found much to throw light upon many obscure
passages of this eventful period of our national history, it is probable
that future editions of Mr. Macaulay's brilliant narrative of it will
afford ample proof.</p>

<p><i>The Antiquarian Etching Club</i>, which was instituted two or three years
since for the purpose of rescuing from oblivion, and preserving by means
of the graver, objects of antiquarian interest, has just issued the
first part of its publications for 1851. This contains twenty-one plates
of various degrees of merit, but all of great interest to the antiquary,
who looks rather for fidelity of representation than for artistic
effect.</p>

</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Mr. Sharpe's reasons for advocating changes in the nomenclature
   of Rickman are worthy of attention, coming from an author who has
   entered very deeply into the analysis of Gothic architecture, and
   who has, in his 'Architectural Parallels,' followed a method of
   demonstration which has the highest possible
   value."&mdash;<i>Architectural Quarterly Review.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The author of one of the noblest architectural works of modern
   times. His 'Architectural Parallels' are worthy of the best days
   of art, and show care and knowledge of no common kind. All his
   lesser works have been marked in their degree by the same careful
   and honest spirit. His attempt to discriminate our architecture
   into periods and assign to it a new nomenclature, is therefore
   entitled to considerable respect."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
